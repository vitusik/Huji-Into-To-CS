contains:
because of that function I used the Merge Sort algorithm
and binary search algorithm so my runtime wouldn't surpass O(logn)

encounter:
runtime is O(logn) because og the binary search that I use in the beginning of the function
even though there is a list change inside with runtime of n, because the length of the list
was decided inside the constructor of the class then its runtime becomes O(1)

encountered_all:
runtime is O(n) because there are n iterations inside the function  

reset:
runtime is O(1) because the length of the list was calculated in the counter so the action inside 
that function are list in the length of 1 multiplied by a constant
