assignment 9:
if we try to iterate again, nothing will happen because the self.__current is pointing
to the end of the queue

assignment 10:
the difference is that I've added a field self.__stop
and when the queue has reached its end, meaning has_stop function 
returned False,then StopIteration exception is raised 


assignment 12:
the runtime of the function is O(n**2)
the function iterates twice on each queue so its runtime is O(n)
and each en queuing of a task takes runtime of O(n) at the worst scenario 


assignment 13:
the runtime of the function is O(n)
because the function iterates over the queues once its runtime O(n)
and each time its checks whether the task in each queue are equal and its runtime is O(1)
